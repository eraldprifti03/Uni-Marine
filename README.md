## http://ism.dmst.aueb.gr/ismgroup6/Uni-Marine.jsp

Development of a shipping company application that allows shipowners (business owners) to create an account by providing their company name, username, and password. After successfully creating an account, they will be able to register their ships one by one by filling in the required details.

From that point, the captain of each ship can create an account using the ship's unique IMO code. The captain will be able to upload a CSV file containing the passenger list of the ship, which the shipowner will have access to view.

Finally, both the captain and the shipowner will have the ability to select the departure and destination ports from a predefined list and view the estimated travel time.
